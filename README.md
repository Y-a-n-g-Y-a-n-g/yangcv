# Academic CV Site (Pure HTML)

This is a bilingual (English/Chinese) academic CV website built with plain HTML, CSS, and a tiny JS helper.

## How to Use

- Open `index.html` in your browser for English (default).
- Open `zh/index.html` for Chinese.

No build tools or installations are required.

## Customize Content

Edit the following files directly:

- `index.html` — English content (default)
- `zh/index.html` — Chinese content
- `styles.css` — styling

## Assets

Place your portrait here:

- `assets/avatar.jpg` — portrait

If you don’t provide it, the page still renders.
