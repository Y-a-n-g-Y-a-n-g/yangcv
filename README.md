# Academic CV Site (Pure HTML)

This is a bilingual (Chinese/English) academic CV website built with plain HTML, CSS, and a tiny JS helper.

## How to Use

- Open `index.html` in your browser for Chinese.
- Open `en/index.html` for English.

No build tools or installations are required.

## Customize Content

Edit the following files directly:

- `index.html` — Chinese content
- `en/index.html` — English content
- `styles.css` — styling

## Assets

Place your portrait here:

- `assets/avatar.jpg` — portrait

If you don’t provide it, the page still renders.
